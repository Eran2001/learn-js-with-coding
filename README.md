# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

#### A High-Level, Multi-Paradigm, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, Single-Threaded(executes commands sequentially, one at a time) and Garbage-Collected Programming Language.

## ✅Strict Mode

#### Use strict mode for safe javascript coding, it will show proper error messages.

```bash
"use strict"
```

## ✅Statements vs Expressions

#### An expression evaluates to a value, while a statement performs an action and does not, by itself, produce a value that can be used elsewhere in the code

## ✅Functions

#### A reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value when it is called or "invoked"

```bash
function myFunc() {}

const myFunc = () => {}

function () {}

function myFunc(a, b) {}
```

### Functions declaration vs expression

#### Syntax

Refers to how a function is written in JavaScript, either as a
function declaration using the function keyword or as a function expression assigned to a variable.

#### Availability

Means when the function can be used in the code—function declarations can be called
anywhere in their scope, while function expressions can only be called after they are defined.

#### Hoisting

Is JavaScript’s behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before execution;
function declarations are fully hoisted, but in function expressions only the variable name is hoisted, not the function itself.
