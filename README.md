# JavaScript

## Strict Mode

#### Use strict mode for safe javascript coding, it will show proper error messages.

```bash
"use strict"
```

## Functions

#### A reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value when it is called or "invoked"

```bash
function myFunc() {}

const myFunc = () => {}

function () {}

function myFunc(a, b) {}
```

### Functions declaration vs expression

#### Syntax -> refers to how a function is written in JavaScript, either as a

               function declaration using the function keyword or as a function expression assigned to a variable.

#### Availability -> means when the function can be used in the code—function declarations can be called

                     anywhere in their scope, while function expressions can only be called after they are defined.

#### Hoisting -> is JavaScript’s behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before execution;

                 function declarations are fully hoisted, but in function expressions only the variable name is hoisted, not the function itself.
